# Katmai Vision Lab

**Katmai Vision Lab** is the GitHub organization for a University of Washington ENGINE Industry Capstone project that applies computer vision and machine learning to real-world ecological research.

This GitHub organization serves as the central home for all technical work related to the project, including core pipeline code, design documentation, testing results, and final deliverables. The long-term goal is to release a clean, well-documented, open-source computer vision pipeline that can be reused or extended by wildlife researchers, conservation groups, and ecological data scientists working in Katmai and beyond.

## Project

**Computer Vision Pipeline to Detect, Track & Quantify Feeding Habits of Katmai NPP Alaskan Brown Bears**

This project focuses on building an open-source, Python-based computer vision pipeline that analyzes video data from Katmai National Park & Preserve. The system is designed to automatically detect and track individual Alaskan brown bears, count salmon attempting to jump Brooks Falls, and quantify feeding behavior over time. In addition to visual analysis, the pipeline will integrate environmental context such as water level, stream flow, weather, and time of day to support deeper ecological insight.

Video data is sourced primarily from Explore.org bear cams in the Brooks Falls and Brooks River region.

## Program & Sponsorship

This project is part of the **ENGINE Industry Capstone Program** at the University of Washington. It is sponsored by the UW Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) Department and the UW eScience Institute.

The project sponsor and industry liaison is Alex Sinclair. Technical mentorship is provided by Dr. Valentina Staneva (UW eScience Institute) and Dr. Mahmood Hameed (UW ECE).

## Student Team

The project is developed by Team Katmai:

- Chloe Zhong — ECE PMP, 1st-year MS  
- Jingwen Li — ECE PMP, 1st-year MS  
- Kaito Yan — MS EE, 2nd-year  
- Darian Ding — ECE PMP, 1st-year MS  
- Oorjit Chowdhary — ECE & Economics, Senior  

The team brings experience across backend systems, infrastructure, embedded systems, and machine learning, and is using this project to deepen skills in applied computer vision and end-to-end system development.

## Scope

The system is designed to run on a consumer-grade laptop or desktop and ingest short-form video clips (1–15 minutes). From these inputs, it will produce structured outputs including individual and total bear counts, bear movement trajectories, salmon jump counts, and feeding behavior metrics. These results will be paired with environmental data to enable analysis across time, conditions, and location.

All source code, documentation, design artifacts, and evaluation results will live in this organization.

## Timeline

The project runs from **January 5, 2026 to June 5, 2026**.
